IRiSS 2019 Summer Workshop
===

Hello!

If you are attending the R workshop, follow the instructions in `R/README.md` to get started.

If you are attending the Python workshop, follow the instructions in `py/README.md` to get started.

## Setup

### JupyterLab

Hopefully you can get [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed on your local computer. You can follow the guides in either the `R` or `py` READMEs for more information about how to configure the environment for those workshops.

Sometimes installing software goes badly. If you aren't able to get JupyterLab set up on your own, we will give you access to our cloud Jupyter platform: https://scpl-jupyter.org. Ask one of the workshop instructors for access (you will need a GitHub account to log in).

### Slack

To faciliate discussion during the workshop please join the `r-py-workshop` channel in the [Stanford Computational Social Science](https://stanford-css.slack.com) workspace. 

### Getting class materials

To get the class materials, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/stanford-policylab/iriss-workshop
```

This will download the class materials as a [git repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) onto your computer.
