IRiSS 2019 Summer Workshop
===

Hello!

If you are attending the R workshop, follow the instructions in `R/README.md` to get started.

If you are attending the Python workshop, follow the instructions in `py/README.md` to get started.

## Setup

### JupyterLab

Hopefully you can get [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed on your local computer. You can follow the guides in either the `R` or `py` READMEs for more information about how to configure the environment for those workshops.

### JupyterHub

Sometimes installing software goes badly. If you aren't able to get JupyterLab set up on your own, we will give you access to our cloud Jupyter platform: https://scpl-jupyterhub.org. Ask one of the workshop instructors for access (you will need a GitHub account to log in).
