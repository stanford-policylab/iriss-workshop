    "1. üåèWe have a database of several thousand places which we'd like to display on a map, but we only have their addresses. In order to display them on the map, we need their latitude/longitude values. (For the uninitiated, this process is known as *geocoding*.)\n",
    "2. üá∫üá∏With the goal of analyzing sentiment or perhaps the relative frequency of descriptors of various candidates, we would like to find all New York Times articles relating to the 2020 election. Perhaps we'd additionally like to collect relevant tweets about the candidates.\n",

    "1. üåèFire up a browser, open Google Maps, type in the first address, copy/paste the lat/lng into the database (i.e. spreadsheet); move on to the second address and repeat the process, and so on until we're done.\n",
    "2. üá∫üá∏Navigate to the New York Times website and enter \"2020 election\" in the search bar, click on each article in the search results, determine that the article is in fact relevant, save the article somewhere, and move on to the next one, and so on until we're pretty sure we've got all relevant articles.\n",
