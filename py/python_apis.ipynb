    "## 0. Why APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have a database of several thousand places which we'd like to display on a map, but we only have their addresses. In order to display them on the map, we need their latitude/longitude values. (For the uninitiated, this process is known as \"geocoding\".)\n",
    "2. With the goal of analyzing sentiment or perhaps the relative frequency of descriptors of various candidates, we would like to find all New York Times articles relating to the 2020 election. Perhaps we'd additionally like to collect relevant tweets about the candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, we can imagine what the naÃ¯ve solution might look like, done by hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fire up a browser, open Google Maps, type in the first address, copy/paste the lat/lng into the database (i.e. spreadsheet); move on to the second address and repeat the process, and so on until we're done.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the New York Times website and enter \"2020 election\" in the search bar, click on each article in the search results, determine that the article is in fact relevant, save the article somewhere, and move on to the next one, and so on until we're pretty sure we've got all relevant articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is terrible. It looks like we've lined up some seriously painstaking work for ourselves. There must be a way to automate this stuff...\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the **Application Programming Interface (API)**. If someone (or some corporate entity---a needless distinction, as corporations are people, after all) has already created a service that solves our underlying need, e.g. Google Maps or the NYTimes search bar, then there's a good chance in this day and age that that service offers an API, which is essentially a tightly controlled, programmatic way to interact with the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most obvious benefits is that we can automate away the tedium of doing the same thing many times. Another benefit, more relevant to application developers, is the ability to build \"on top of\" someone else's API in order to focus on a specific thing we want to accomplish. Consider, for example, building a real-time logistics app that displays the current location of our fleet of vehicles; all we have are the real-time GPS coordinates, so we use another service (e.g. Mapbox or Google/Apple/Bing Maps) for displaying the underlying roads and geographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully by this point you're convinced of the potential utility of APIs. Let's get started!"

    "\n",
    "Continuing with the first scenario mentioned in the introduction above, let's suppose we have a set of addresses, and we need the latitude/longitude pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We *could* use the Google Maps Geocoding API for this, but today (and this wasn't the case just a few years back) the service requires you to set up a billing account with a valid credit card before you can use the API, and i'd rather not get bogged down by that issue right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead, let's use the [US Census Geocoding API](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/Geocoding_Services_API.html). The results won't be quite as high-quality (interpolated vs. rooftop), but the service is public and free, and illustrates the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. A first pass\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, using this API boils down to figuring out the right URL and parameters to send an HTTP request to. Let's take the address of Huang Engineering Center as an example: `475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305`. After reading the instructions on how to use the census geocoding API, we determine that one way to make this request is:\n",

    "(We won't talk about the `benchmark` argument for the purposes of this tutorial, but we'll touch on the `format` argument later. The `address` is the interesting thing here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make HTTP requests from Python, we'll use the `requests` library ([docs](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/)), which is not part of the standard library but makes web requests very simple. (This will come in handy when scraping later.) We'll also need `json` from the standard library, for making sense of the response data."
