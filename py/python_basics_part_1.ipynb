    "`Python` is a flexible and widely used programming language in data science and software engineering. Unlike many programming languages, one of the central tenets of the design (and writing) of `Python` is that `Python` code should be _easy to read_. Python is frequently used in a wide range of applications, from web development to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do people like to use `Python`? `Python` is:\n",
    "* Fast,\n",
    "* Modular,\n",
    "* Object-oriented,\n",
    "* Extensible (i.e., there are _lots_ of libraries),\n",
    "* Easy to read,\n",
    "* Most importantly: gets the job done.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` is the name of a programming language. But different people often interface with `Python` in a number of different ways:\n",
    "1. Running interactive commands with the `python` interpreter. This is done by typing in `python` (or `python3`, if you have `Python 2` and `Python 3` installed on your computer) at the command line.\n",
    "<img src=img/ss_python_interp.png width=500>\n",
    "2. Python development in some kind of text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).\n",

    "1. Replace all quotation marks in the string **`s`** with an underbar ('\\_').\n",
    " - to be precise, you're not *replacing* the quotations, but *reassigning* the variable **`s`** with a copy of the old **`s`** that has underbars replacing quotations; remember that `python` strings are **immutable** (i.e., they are NEVER changed, only reassigned).\n",
    " - this was not covered above, but you should use `python`'s `replace()` method for strings; now would be a good time to practice reading the docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace).\n",
    "1. Split the string **`s`** into a list named **`words`**.\n",
    "1. Count the length of the string **`s`** and the list **`words`**.\n",
    "1. Join the elements of the list **`words`** into a comma separated string.\n",

    "## Exercise 2.\n",
    "1. Create a very, very _long_ string that contains all of Charles Dickens's _A Tale of Two Cities_ using the following code. (Don't worry that this doesn't make much sense now---we'll get to what's going on here in the next lesson.) `with open(\"data/two_cities.txt\", \"r\") as f: ttc = f.read()`\n",
    "2. Turn `ttc` into a list by splitting on spaces (i.e., the string `\" \"`). How many words is _A Tale of Two Cities_?\n",

    "1. Turn `ttc` from the previous exercise into a dictionary using the following code. (Don't worry if this code doesn't make sense.) `ttc = {word:ttc.count(word) for word in ttc[:1000]}`\n",
    "- This dictionary is made up of the following `key: value` pairs: the keys are the first 1000 words in _A Tale of Two Cities_, and the values are the number of times the word appears in the whole book.\n",
    "- This might take a little while, so don't be alarmed if this doesn't happen right away.\n",
