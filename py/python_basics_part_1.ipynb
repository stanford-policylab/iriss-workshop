Python is frequently used in a wide range of applications, from web development to machine learning.\n",

    "* Easy to read,\n",
    "* Most importantly: gets the job done.\n",

    "`Python` is the name of a programming language. But different people often interface with `Python` in a number of different ways:\n",
    "1. Running interactive commands with the `python` interpreter. This is done by typing in `python` (or `python3`, if you have `Python 2` and `Python 3` installed on your computer) at the command line.\n",

    "There are three basic ways of changing your codes behavior depending on the input: `if` statements, `for` statements, and `while` statements. At a high level, `if` statements only do something (surprise, surprise) if something is true: you only take the square root of a number if it's positive or open a file if it actually exists. On the other hand, `for` statements do the same thing for everything in a group: if you want to double every number in a list or extract the phone number of everyone in your address book, use a `for` statement. While they're very important in other languages, `while` statements are very rarely necessary in `Python`. If you're using a `while` statement, chances are you could do the same thing more safely and more cleanly with a `for` statement."

    "Let's try and put this all together to do something a bit more like a programming problem you're likely to encounter \"in the wild.\" You should spend a few minutes on this and work with the other people at your table. You'll need some of the functions we talk about in the next section (\"Convenience functions for lists and strings\")---we'll give you some hints, but this is also an opportunity to practice reading how code works, which is a very important skill. (You'll also need a function that we _don't_ talk about, so you'll need to practice looking at the official documentation. Feel free to look back to [Section 0.4](#help) for help with that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, here's what we're asking you to do:\n",
    "1. Declare a string variable named **`s`**, that has the value:\n",
    "> \"Double quotes\" and single 'quotes' are equally acceptable in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make `Python` count how many times the letter `t` appears in the string **`s`**.\n",
    "3. Replace all quotation marks in the string **`s`** with an underbar ('\\_').\n",
    "4. Split the string **`s`** into a list named **`words`**.\n",
    "5. Count the length of the string **`s`** and the list **`words`**.\n",
    "6. Join the elements of the list **`words`** into a comma separated string.\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__ You're going to need a few different functions: `.split()`, `.count()`, `len()`, `.join()`, and `.replace()`. The functions with names that begin with a `.` are called _methods_. Generally speaking, instead of giving a method the string (or list) you want it to act on, like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    >>> .split(\"(414)-123-4567\", \"-\") # Wrong\n",
    "```\n",
    "you put the method _after_ the string you want to change, like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    >>> \"(414)-123-4567\".split(\"-\") # Right\n",
    "    [\"(414)\", \"123\", \"4567\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Be careful with `join()`! You might find that it works a little differently from what you expect. If you run into trouble, you know where to find help!\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__  When you get to Part 3, to be precise, you're not *replacing* the quotations, but *reassigning* the variable **`s`** with a copy of the old **`s`** that has underbars replacing quotations; remember that `python` strings are **immutable** (i.e., they are NEVER changed, only reassigned). Note that `.replace()` is not covered below, but you should use `python`'s `replace()` method for strings; now would be a good time to practice reading the docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace)."
