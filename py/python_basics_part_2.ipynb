    "1. How do we manipulate our data---and, in particular, how do we do the _same_ thing to different things?\n",
    "2. How do we store our work for later use, and how do we load up work that other people have done for us ahead of time?\n",
    "The first problem is solved with _functions_, which allow you to \"bottle\" code you've already written and use it when you need it. (You're already a pro at this point---we've been using functions informally the entire day.) The second problem is solved with `Python`'s I/O (or \"input / output\") interface."
