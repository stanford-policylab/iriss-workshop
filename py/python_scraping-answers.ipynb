    "# Web Scraping with Python 🐍\n",
    "\n",
    "## _Turning the web into data_\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're experts in (the basics of) Python, it's time to head out to the real world and test our Python mettle.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem that comes up over and over in research applications is that we find a website that has the exact data we need for our work, but they don't provide an API for us to access it cleanly. Instead, we may see the data either in a table on the website, or even formatted so we have to click on links and jump around the site to see all of the data we need. As a result, we end up copying data by hand, a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone endeavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. The Problem 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example this list on Wikipedia of named lakes in California: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_in_California\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend we need such a list for a project we're working on. Specifically, we want a list of lakes and information about them, including their geographic coordinates, surface area, maximum depth, and water volume. It would be a real pain to copy every entry in that table. Moreover, we cannot see details such as coordinates, water volume, and maximum depth without clicking on each of the links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than copying all these data by hand, we will use Python to automate the data collection process, to produce a tidy CSV we can use in our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. A word of caution ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping falls in a murky legal area, but courts appear to be [looking favorably](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/dc-court-accessing-public-information-not-computer-crime) on the practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, you should always make sure the data are available for you to use in your work. Sometimes the incantations of a website's terms & conditions will prohibit this entirely. For example, an exercise we could have done is to collect snowfall data for California ski resorts from [OnTheSnow](https://www.onthesnow.com). However, [that website's terms and conditions](https://www.onthesnow.com/terms) explicitly prohibit automated---and even manual!---data collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even when a website does not explicitly prohibit scraping---and even if courts decide terms prohibiting scraping are meaningless---you should always be considerate when collecting data. When you open a website, there is a piece of software running on a physical computer somewhere that sends you the content you've requested. These resources are **not free and unlimited**: someone is paying to run this infrastructure, and it can only handle a limited number of requests at a time. When you automate web requests, it's easy to make thousands of requests very quickly. At worst, [this can overwhelm the website and bring it down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), making it unavailable to anyone who wants to access it. In many cases, the server will detect that you are a robot and block you. (Note also that when you are on a shared network such as Stanford's, the server's block may affect your peers as well!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 How do I respect the server? 🙇\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally this just means rate-limiting your requests. In Python we will use the `time.sleep` function to pause your script for a specified number of seconds (say, 1 second) between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 `robots.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sites will include a `robots.txt` file that describes rules for automated access of their site. We will not go over `robots.txt` in detail in this workshop, but it is a good idea to check this file before scraping a website. To view it, simply append `/robots.txt` to the domain name: for example, `https://www.wikipedia.org/robots.txt` shows Wikipedia's very detailed `robots.txt` file. See [this guide](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) for more information about the syntax of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 What else should I fear? 👹\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/recaptcha.png\" width=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a ReCAPTCHA. Google provides this service to websites that wish to discourage automated access. There are a lot of details about ReCAPTCHA, but the bottom line is: if you start seeing them pop up, you've been busted as a web scraper and need to throttle your script more. You may be out of luck for scraping your target website until Google lets you out of its digital doghouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Getting ready 💪\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll install some new modules:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [`requests`](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) - For all of the human-centeredness of Python, the standard library `urllib` is a real pain to make web requests with. Instead we'll use this third-party module that makes HTTP requests dead simple.\n",
    " - [`BeautifulSoup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - This is a powerful module that parses HTML, the markup languages used to display websites. It deals gracefully with all sorts of messy situations you will encounter in the wild, where websites are written improperly. Generally you can trust it to do the right thing and you don't need to know any of the details of what that means."

    "### 3.1 Inspecting HTML 🔬\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start writing anything in Python, we need first to understand how this website is put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will **inspect** the HTML of the Website.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chrome, try right clicking on the first column header that reads \"Name\" and select \"Inspect\" on the menu that appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/inspect.png\" width=500 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can see how that table is constructed. In the window that pops up, you should see something like the following markup:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/lakes_table_markup.png\" width=500 />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1 But wait, what is this \"HTML\" ... ? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't familiar with HTML, don't worry too much. But, you will need to learn eight fun facts about it very quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every website you've ever seen is formatted with **HTML**.\n",
    "2. HTML is a **markup language**. That means it is not a _programming_ language to give computer arbitrary instructions; rather it simply dresses up plain text to describe how it should be presented.\n",
    "3. The symbols used to dress up text are called **tags**.\n",
    "4. The name of the tag is always enclosed in angle brackets. Generally there is an **opening tag** written like `<foo>` followed later by a **closing tag** written as `</foo>`.\n",
    "5. The combination of an opening tag, its content (if there is any), and a closing tag is called an **element**.\n",
    "6. For example, to make text bold, I might use the `strong` tag: `I AM SHOUTING <strong>LOUDLY</strong>`. (The `LOUDLY` will be rendered in boldface.)\n",
    "7. HTML tags can be **nested**. As a result, you can think of the entire document as a **hierarchy** of tags. The content of the website will always be found enclosed within a `<body></body>` tag. For example, `<body><p>Hello, <em>friend</em>!</p></body>` will display a friendly greeting inside a paragraph (`<p>`), with the word \"friend\" italicized (`em`).\n",
    "8. HTML tags can have **attributes**. Some attributes are semantic and change what a tag means on the page. Other attributes are cosmetic and change only how the tag appears. Still other attributes serve as metadata that is used for a variety of purposes, perhaps to identify that tag among similar tags on a page, or to add annotations for accessibility devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.2 What can HTML do for me, an aspiring web scraper? 🧐\n",
    "\n",
    "A webpage may have a large volume of text decorated with hundreds or thousands of HTML tags. Within that gigantic haystack is the tiny needle of information you want to pluck out of it. Your job in writing a scraper is to write a script that can not only locate that needle on one website, but is robust enough to locate the needles in a set of haystacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we are typically dealing with reasonably well-structured haystacks with needles that have been placed systematically into them, in a predictable location. So if we find the needle in one haystack, we just have to write down the description of the location so we can find the needle in all haystacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will describe the needle's location in terms of the HTML tags and their attributes. Once we inspect the page to locate the element that contains the information we want to scrape, there are three main observations we want to make about our target:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What type of tag is this? Some elements have well-defined structures that simplify parsing. For example, `<table>` elements always have rows defined by `<tr>` elements and cells within those rows defined by `<td>` elements.\n",
    "2. Does this tag have any identifying attributes? The gold standard is to find an element with an `id` attribute, because these are (nearly) always unique on the page. Often you will find a `class` attribute that is also very useful.\n",
    "3. Where does this element fall in the page hierarchy? Do any of this element's parents have identifying marks? Perhaps the element that immediately contains your needle is a plain old `<span>` tag ... but maybe directly above it there is a `<div>` with an ID that you can use to locate the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these techniques, we can create a heuristic rule that finds the needle in all of the pages we are targetting. Some examples of the heuristics we're writing are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - \"Find the `<div>` the `id=\"my_data\"` and then take the text of the third `<span>` tag inside of it\"\n",
    " - \"Find the second table on the page and extract the `href` attribute from every `<a>` tag inside the second cell in all but the first row.\"\n",
    " - \"Extract the text of every `<span>` with the class `\"my-value\"` and remove all non-numeric characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3 That sounds tedious! 🙀\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be! But often it's easier than it sounds. Let's try it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Fetching a website with Python 🐶\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will use `requests` to load the HTML of the lakes Wikipedia page."
